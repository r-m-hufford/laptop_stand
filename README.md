# laptop_stand
.stp, .stl, prusa (.3mf) and fusion 360 (f3d) files for a laptop stand I designed for a 13 inch MacBook Pro. 

All designing was done specifically to avoid the use of supports. Supports are only needed for a small portion of the top piece.

Hardware: 
(2) 8-32 wing nuts
(2) 8 washers
(2) 8-32 x 3/4 machine screws

(18) 8-32 nuts
(18) 8-32 x 3/8 machine screws

optional hardware:
(4) 8 wood screws for attaching permently to a desk
        - size 10 will also work but are slightly large
